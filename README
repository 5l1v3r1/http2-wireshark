Wireshark dissector for HTTP-draft-04/2.0

This package provides skeletal support for dissecting HTTP/2.0
frames in wireshark.  The functionality at this point is fairly
basic but does give visibility to frames and attempts to sanely
deal with segmented frames, though that functionality seems a bit
buggy at this point.

This code and patch was developed against wireshark 1.11.0 on OS X
10.8.4.  I have no idea if it will work with earlier versions or
on other operating system.


INSTALLATION

Obtain and build the wireshark source:

http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsdg_html_chunked/ChSrcObtain.html

I built this on a mac running 10.8.4 and macports.  The only trick
I ran into once the listed prerequisites were installed was to make certain
the proper glib was uses.  Here is my recipie:

$ export PKG_CONFIG=/opt/local/bin/pkg-config
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/local/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
$ ./autogen.sh
$ CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib ./configure --prefix /opt/local
$ make

You will want to make certain you build wireshark with gnutls in order
to use the TLS decryption functionality.

Once you know wireshark builds, apply the include patch for the makefiles,
copy packet-http2.c into epan/dissectors/, and rebuild.


USAGE

As most (all?) of today's HTTP/2.0 traffic is going over TLS you will
need to make use of the decryption functionality of the wireshark
SSL dissector.  There are many tutorials out on the web for this,
but at a high level, go to the SSL protocol preferences, click
on 'Edit...' for the 'RSA keys list', and then add an entry for the
ip/port combination you want to decrypt.  The protocol you should add
is 'http2'.

Note that the easiest way to do this is to make certain you are using
straight RSA without DH and its variants.

Once you properly set up the SSL decryption ( probably the hardest part )
the http2 frames should be visible.
